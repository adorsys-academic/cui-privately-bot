Using Slots
===========

:ref:`Here <slot_types>` is the full list of slot types defined by Rasa Core.

**Slots are your bot's memory.** They act as a key-value store
which can be used to store information the user provided (e.g their home city)
as well as information gathered about the outside world (e.g. the result of a
database query).

Most of the time, you want slots to influence how the dialogue progresses.
There are different slot types for different behaviors.

For example, if your user has provided their home city, you might
have a ``text`` slot called ``home_city``. If the user asks for the
weather, and you *don't* know their home city, you will have to ask
them for it. A ``text`` slot only tells Rasa Core whether the slot
has a value. The specific value of a ``text`` slot (e.g. Bangalore
or New York or Hong Kong) doesn't make any difference.

If the value itself is important, use a ``categorical`` slot. There are
also ``boolean``, ``float``, and ``list`` slots.
If you just want to store some data, but don't want it to affect the flow
of the conversation, use an ``unfeaturized`` slot.


How Rasa Uses Slots
-------------------

The :class:`rasa_core.policies.Policy` doesn't have access to the
value of your slots. It receives a ``featurized`` representation.
As mentioned above, for a ``text`` slot the value is irrelevant.
The policy just sees a ``1`` or ``0`` depending on whether it is set.

**You should choose your slot types carefully!**

How Slots Get Set
-----------------

You can provide an initial value for a slot in your domain file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    slots:
      name:
        type: text
        initial_value: "human"


There are multiple ways that slots are set during a conversation:

Slots Set from NLU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your NLU model picks up an entity, and your domain contains a
slot with the same name, the slot will be set automatically. For example:

.. code-block:: story

   # story_01
   * greet{"name": "Ali"}
     - slot{"name": "Ali"}
     - utter_greet

In this case, you don't have to include the ``- slot{}`` part in the
story, because it is automatically picked up.


Slots Set By Clicking Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use buttons as a shortcut.
Rasa Core will send messages starting with a ``/`` to the
``RegexInterpreter``, which expects NLU input in the same format
as in story files, e.g. ``/intent{entities}``. For example, if you let
users choose a color by clicking a button, the button payloads might
be ``/choose{"color": "blue"}`` and ``/choose{"color": "red"}``.

You can specify this in your domain file like this:
(see details in :ref:`domain`)

.. code-block:: yaml

  utter_ask_color:
  - text: "what color would you like?"
    buttons:
    - title: "blue"
      payload: '/choose{"color": "blue"}'
    - title: "red"
      payload: '/choose{"color": "red"}'


Slots Set by Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second option is to set slots by returning events in :ref:`customactions`.
In this case, your stories need to include the slots.
For example, you have a custom action to fetch a user's profile, and
you have a ``categorical`` slot called ``account_type``.
When the ``fetch_profile`` action is run, it returns a
:class:`rasa_core.events.SlotSet` event:

.. code-block:: yaml

   slots:
      account_type:
         type: categorical
         values:
         - premium
         - basic

.. code-block:: python

   from rasa_core_sdk.actions import Action
   from rasa_core_sdk.events import SlotSet
   import requests

   class FetchProfileAction(Action):
       def name(self):
           return "fetch_profile"

       def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
           url = "http://myprofileurl.com"
           data = requests.get(url).json
           return [SlotSet("account_type", data["account_type"])]


.. code-block:: story

   # story_01
   * greet
     - action_fetch_profile
     - slot{"account_type" : "premium"}
     - utter_welcome_premium

   # story_02
   * greet
     - action_fetch_profile
     - slot{"account_type" : "basic"}
     - utter_welcome_basic


In this case you **do** have to include the ``- slot{}`` part in your stories.
Rasa Core will learn to use this information to decide on the correct action to
take (in this case, ``utter_welcome_premuim`` or ``utter_welcome_basic``).

.. note::
   It is **very easy** to forget about slots if you are writing
   stories by hand. We strongly recommend that you build up these
   stories using :ref:`interactive_learning` rather than writing them.



Custom Slot Types
-----------------

Maybe your restaurant booking system can only handle bookings
for up to 6 people. In this case you want the *value* of the
slot to influence the next selected action (and not just whether
it's been specified). You can do this by defining a custom slot class.

In the code below, we define a slot class called ``NumberOfPeopleSlot``.
The featurization defines how the value of this slot gets converted to a vector
to our machine learning model can deal with.
Our slot has three possible "values", which we can represent with
a vector of length ``2``.

+---------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``(0,0)``     | not yet set                              |
+---------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``(1,0)``     | between 1 and 6                          |
+---------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``(0,1)``     | more than 6                              |
+---------------+------------------------------------------+


.. testcode::

   from rasa_core.slots import Slot

   class NumberOfPeopleSlot(Slot):

       def feature_dimensionality(self):
           return 2

       def as_feature(self):
           r = [0.0] * self.feature_dimensionality()
           if self.value:
               if self.value <= 6:
                   r[0] = 1.0
               else:
                   r[1] = 1.0
       return r

Now we also need some training stories, so that Rasa Core
can learn from these how to handle the different situations:


.. code-block:: story

   # story1
   ...
   * inform{"people": "3"}
   - action_book_table
   ...
   # story2
   * inform{"people": "9"}
   - action_explain_table_limit


.. include:: feedback.inc
