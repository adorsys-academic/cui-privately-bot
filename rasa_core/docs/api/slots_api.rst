Slot Types
==========

Text Slot
---------

.. option:: text

   :Use For: User preferences where you only care whether or not they've
             been specified.
   :Example:
      .. sourcecode:: yaml

         slots:
            cuisine:
               type: text
   :Description:
       :class:`rasa_core.slots.Slot`
       Results in the feature of the slot being set to ``1`` if any value is set.
       Otherwise the feature will be set to ``0`` (no value is set).

Boolean Slot
------------

.. option:: bool

   :Use For: True or False
   :Example:
      .. sourcecode:: yaml

         slots:
            is_authenticated:
               type: bool
   :Description:
       Checks if slot is set and if True

Categorical Slot
----------------

.. option:: categorical

   :Use For: Slots which can take one of N values
   :Example:
      .. sourcecode:: yaml

         slots:
            risk_level:
               type: categorical
               values:
               - low
               - medium
               - high

   :Description:
      Creates a one-hot encoding describing which of the ``values`` matched.

Float Slot
----------

.. option:: float

   :Use For: Continuous values
   :Example:
      .. sourcecode:: yaml

         slots:
            temperature:
               type: float
               min_value: -100.0
               max_value:  100.0

   :Defaults: ``max_value=1.0``, ``min_value=0.0``
   :Description:
      All values below ``min_value`` will be treated as ``min_value``, the same
      happens for values above ``max_value``. Hence, if ``max_value`` is set to
      ``1``, there is no difference between the slot values ``2`` and ``3.5`` in
      terms of featurization (e.g. both values will influence the dialogue in
      the same way and the model can not learn to differentiate between them).

List Slot
---------

.. option:: list

   :Use For: Lists of values
   :Example:
      .. sourcecode:: yaml

         slots:
            shopping_items:
               type: list
   :Description:
       The feature of this slot is set to ``1`` if a value with a list is set,
       where the list is not empty. If no value is set, or the empty list is the
       set value, the feature will be ``0``. The **length of the list stored in
       the slot does not influence the dialogue**.

Unfeaturized Slot
-----------------

.. option:: unfeaturized

   :Use For: Data you want to store which shouldn't influence the dialogue flow
   :Example:
      .. sourcecode:: yaml

         slots:
            internal_user_id:
               type: unfeaturized
   :Description:
       There will not be any featurization of this slot, hence its value does
       not influence the dialogue flow and is ignored when predicting the next
       action the bot should run.
