^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed
-----

[0.11.4] - 2018-09-19
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- a flag ``--fail_on_prediction_errors`` to the ``evaluate.py`` script -
  if used when running the evaluation, the script will fail with a non
  0 exit code if there is at least one prediction error. This can be
  used on CIs to validate models against test stories.
- JWT support: parameters to allow clients to authenticate requests to
  the rasa_core.server using JWT's in addition to normal token based auth
- added socket.io input / output channel
- ``UserMessage`` and ``UserUttered`` classes have a new attribute
  ``input_channel`` that stores the name of the ``InputChannel``
  through which the message was received

  as a text file
- do not run actions during evaluation. instead, action are only predicted
  and validated against the gold story.

- made finetuning during online learning optional (use ``--finetune`` if
  you want to enable it)

Removed
-------
- package pytest-services since it wasn't necessary

Fixed
-----
- fixed an issue with the followup (there was a name confusion, sometimes
  the followup action would be set to the non existent ``follow_up_action``
  attribute instead of ``followup_action``)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- support for Rasa Core usage as a server with remote action execution

Changed

- renamed ``rasa_dm.util`` to ``rasa_dm.utils``
- renamed the whole package to ``rasa_core`` (so ``rasa_dm`` is gone!)
- renamed ``Reminder`` attribute ``id`` to ``name``

- changed ``agent.handle_message(...)`` interface for easier usage

.. _v0-6-0:

[0.6.0] - 2017-08-27
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- support for multiple policies (e.g. one memoization and a Keras policy at the same time)
- loading domains from yaml files instead of defining them with python code
- added an api layer (called ``Agent``) for you to use for 95% of the things you want to do (training, persistence, loading models)
- support for reminders

Changed
-------
- large refactoring of code base

.. _v0-5-0:

[0.5.0] - 2017-06-18
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- ``ScoringPolicy`` added to policy implementations (less strict than standard default policy)
- ``RasaNLUInterpreter`` to run a nlu instance within dm (instead of using the http interface)
- more tests

Changed
-------
- ``UserUtterance`` now holds the complete parse data from nlu (e.g. to access attributes other than entities or intent)
- ``Turn`` has a reference to a ``UserUtterance`` instead of directly storing intent & entities (allows access to other data)
- Simplified interface of output channels
- order of actions in the DefaultPolicy in ``possible_actions`` (``ActionListen`` now always has index 0)

Fixed
-----
- ``RedisTrackerStore`` checks if tracker is stored before accessing it (otherwise a ``None`` access exception is thrown)
- ``RegexInterpreter`` checks if the regex actually matches the message instead of assuming it always does
- ``str`` implementation for all events
- ``Controller`` can be started without an input channel (e.g. messages need to be fed into the queue manually)

.. _v0-2-0:

[0.2.0] - 2017-05-18

First released version.
